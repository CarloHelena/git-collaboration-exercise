# Learn to git

#### Prep

Make sure you have an account in github and that you are logged in. Then just follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your forked copy into your computer (this will be your working copy)

There should now be a folder in your computer that is an exact replica of this repo.


#### Your goal for today

Select one song from the music supplied to you in the USB thumbdrive and try your best to transcribe the lyrics. Please don't look them up on Google, we will do that after this exercise, it's ok if you make mistakes or if there are phrases you don't understand. You can use the word *uninteligible* if you hear something that is impossible for you to transcribe.
